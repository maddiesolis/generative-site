# Generative Art Gallery (Cat Sage Gallery)
Developed in February, 2024.

## Tech Stack
React app using Typescript.

## Concept
This site was created as an interactive, accessible, and personable artwork. Through the use of randomization, the site is always changing in colour, imagery, and text. This work utilizes my own photography and digital drawings, as well as a quiz I created and other pieces of text throughout the site. It aims to make the viewer feel seen and become a part of the work by introspecting and potentially learning things about themselves. Each viewer has their own unique experience when interacting with the work and they can do so from the comfort of their home, not confined to a gallery setting.

## Implementation
- **Styled components**: I used styled-components to keep styles modular and easy to manage. It helps keep styling with the components, avoids global CSS conflicts, and makes it simple to update styles dynamically.
- **SVGs**: I used SVGs for icons and graphics because they are scalable, lightweight, and maintain high quality at any size. They also allow for easy customization, like changing colors, without losing clarity.
React functional components: I used React functional components because they are simpler, easier to read, and make better use of hooks for state and side effects. They also help keep the code modular and maintainable while improving performance by reducing unnecessary re-renders.

## Artwork
The artwork displayed is a combination of digital collage and illustration.
- Photographs were taken by me
- Collages were edited/illustrated in PhotoShop and Clip Studio Paint

The imagery intends to convey serenity, playfulness, and beauty.
